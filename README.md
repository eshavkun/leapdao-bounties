## Rules

### How to earn money by delivering bounties

1. Review the list of "Approved" bounties above
2. Choose the bounty which you feel capable to deliver and which is not assigned yet (no assignee on Github issue)
3. Leave a comment in the bounty issue that you would like to work on the bounty and get approval from bounty Proposer or Verifier.
4. Start working on the issue
    - Within 3 days from the start you must create a WIP pull request for the bounty, which will be used to track the progress.
    - You must actively work on the bounty, otherwise it may be [withdrawn from you](#challenge-period).
    - should you have any questions, problems, suggestions or concerns, communicate them as a comment in the bounty issue.
5. Once you think the bounty is complete (check against the Deliverables), leave a comment asking for review.
6. Bounty completion is reviewed by Proposer and Verifier.
7. If approved as completed, the bounty amount (denominated in DAI) is payed out in ETH at the current rate. Otherwise, you will be asked to make corrections.

### Challenge period

Verifier must regularily track a progress made on his bounties. If there is no significant progress/effort made in last 7 days and there was no prior notice from the bounty assignee, Verifier MAY start a challenge period for the bounty:

- give a 2 days public notice to the assignee to continue working
- if assignee fails to make significant progress/effort within the next 5 days, the bounty is unassigned and is now free for others to start work on.


### Q&A

**How to quantify if the progress/effort is significant?**

This is on discretion of Verifier and Proposer.

**I have a great idea for a bounty, but it is not in the list?**

Great! Propose a [new bounty](http://bounty.leapdao.org/viewform).

**I feel that bounty definition is not clear or vague. What should I do?**

Communicate

**I have bounty assigned but can't work on it now because I'm busy/sick/away/whatever. What should I do?**

Communicate

**I have bounty assigned but I'm stuck and can't make any progress. What should I do?**
